these are just wordlists that will help one when dealing with different situations.

For 6_digits
use the wordlist when you need crack passwords and you are sure the expected password is 6 digits.
An example is when you get a financial statement/bank statement and you dont have the password. Normally they will tell you its a six digit code.
Therefore just get the hashvalue of the document(pdf/zip/docs) then use john the ripper with the above wordlist and get the password.
